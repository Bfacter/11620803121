Project Overview:
This full-stack web application combines React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend to showcase the top N products from various e-commerce companies. The backend handles authentication and product data retrieval, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and comparing products.

Backend (Express.js):
The backend manages authentication with an external server to obtain and refresh access tokens required for accessing product data. It exposes an endpoint (/categories/:categoryName/products) that supports sorting, pagination, and filtering by category, price range, and other criteria. This ensures efficient data retrieval and seamless user experience.

Frontend (React):
The frontend renders a dynamic interface where users can view, sort, and paginate through products fetched from the backend. It includes sorting options by price, rating, and discount, alongside filtering by category. Pagination is implemented to enhance navigation through product listings, prioritizing clarity and ease of use.

Installation Instructions:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
Setup Backend:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
npm start
This starts the Express.js server at http://localhost:3000.

Setup Frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
npm install
npm start
This starts the React development server at http://localhost:3000.

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to explore and interact with the product comparison application.

Access Token Management:
The backend automates access token handling, ensuring seamless operation by refreshing tokens before expiry. This approach guarantees continuous access to product data without user intervention, enhancing reliability and user experience.

By following these steps, you can set up and run both frontend and backend components locally, enabling efficient browsing and comparison of top products from multiple e-commerce platforms. Adjust configurations for production deployment and security as needed.
